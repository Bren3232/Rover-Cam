# Rover-Cam

Rover Cam is a network independent security, and pest control software, to be used on Raspberry Pi.<br/>

On motion detection it can:<br/>
    • record clips, or images<br/>
    • play one or more audio files, or run python files<br/>
    • control up to 8 GPIO pins by turning them on and off, called “Actions”<br/>

With extra electronics and hardware, Rover Cam can be used for pest control, by making sounds that frighten, or irritate animals, by moving an object to scare the animal, or initiating a spray of water, as motion sensing sprinklers do. As a security camera it can sound an alarm, or any custom audio recording, and/or move objects.

Here's a quick look at the UI:<br/>

See manual for set-up.

Update April 19: I fixed a bug, organized files into folders, and made it so that Rover Cam can run from any directory, or USB storage device. Even the name of the containing folder doesn't matter, as long as the files and folders are organized as seen here.
